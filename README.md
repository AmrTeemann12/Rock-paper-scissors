# Rock-paper-scissors
This is a Javascript project for a classic five-round rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. 

The player chooses whether to play rock, paper, or scissors. Then, his choice is compared to a randomly created value translated to either rock, paper, or scissors equally.

Both the player's and the computer's scores are tracked. Finally, the score is added for the winner, and after the five rounds, the winner is announced.
